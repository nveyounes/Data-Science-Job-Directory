🇲🇦 Morocco AI & Data Science Job Directory🛡️ Project Status & ContextStatusFocus AreaTechnologiesData VolumeActiveJob Search / Data AggregationHTML5, Tailwind, JS200+ Companies⭐ Project Goal: Access to OpportunitiesThis repository hosts a specialized, single-page application designed to bridge the gap between Moroccan talent and the growing AI & Data Science ecosystem. It serves as a centralized, interactive database for students and professionals looking for internships or jobs.The main objective was to create a lightweight, serverless tool to aggregate recruiting contacts and allow users to export them for mass outreach.📌 Key Features ImplementedSmart Directory: Searchable database of 200+ companies (OCP, UM6P, Startups, Banks).Data Export: One-click generation of a formatted CSV file containing emails and contact details.Market Analytics: Visual insights into the geographic and sectoral distribution of AI jobs in Morocco.Zero-Config: Runs entirely in the browser with no backend requirements.🛠️ Technology Stack & ArchitectureThis project is built as a highly optimized Single Page Application (SPA).CategoryTechnologyPurposeIconCore StructureHTML5Semantic structure and SEO-friendly layout.StylingTailwind CSSResponsive design and modern UI components.LogicVanilla JavaScriptSearch filtering, CSV generation, and DOM manipulation.VisualizationChart.jsRendering interactive bar and doughnut charts for insights.DataJSON / CSVEmbedded datasets including user-contributed lists.🚀 Application WorkflowThe dashboard operates on a three-stage process:1. Data AggregationSources: Data is aggregated from curated industry lists and community contributions (e.g., specific HR contacts for Marjane, Hertz, Wafa Salaf).Structure: Data is normalized into JSON objects containing Name, City, Sector, and Email.2. Interaction & FilteringSearch Engine: JavaScript logic filters the DOM in real-time based on user input (City or Company Name).Visualization: Charts dynamically update to reflect the "Big Picture" of the Moroccan market.3. Extraction (CSV Engine)Generation: On clicking "Download", the app combines the curated list with synthetic entries to reach the requested volume (200-500 rows).Formatting: The engine cleans company names (removing internal codes like "Division") and formats columns for standard email marketing tools.Download: Triggers a browser-side download of Morocco_AI_Data_Companies_List.csv.🛠️ Installation & HostingPrerequisitesA modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).No installation required for local use.🌐 Hosting on GitHub Pages (Recommended)Upload File:Upload Morocco_AI_Data_Jobs_Dashboard.html to your repository.Optional: Rename it to index.html.Enable Pages:Go to Settings > Pages.Select main branch and /root folder.Click Save.Access:Your dashboard will be live at https://your-username.github.io/repo-name/.💻 Local ExecutionClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git)
